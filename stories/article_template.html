          <p>There is a story among the people of Barrio Logan about a young girl brought to a doctor in San Diego for a second opinion on the cause of her incessant coughing. The child sat on the observation bed and, as the doctor began examining her lung capacity, she quickly noticed the astounding extent to which the lung was degraded. Confused, she asked the parents if they had previously lived in a coal mining town. They explained that they currently resided in Barrio Logan. Understanding washed over the doctorâ€™s face as she nodded slowly, her head downcast.</p>
          * * *<br>
          <p>The issue of higher susceptibility to asthma and other respiratory illnesses is the living reality for the residents of Barrio Logan. This majority Latino and Chicano neighborhood, just south of the trendy Gaslamp Quarter and Padres Stadium, has such poor air quality that it is often used as a case study in college textbooks for unlivable standards in the United States.</p>
          <p>This phenomenon is well-supported by data collected by the Cal Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment for CalEnviroScreen, a mapping tool that uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to map the incidence of environmental risk factors.</p>

          That report placed the 92113 zip-code, which includes Barrio Logan, as having an asthma hospitalization rate higher than 92.9 percent of zip codes across California, with about 81 visits per every 10,000 people. The asthma hospitalization rate is around 2.5 times that of the national average according to a joint investigation by the EPA and the Environmental Health Coalition, a local non-profit.
